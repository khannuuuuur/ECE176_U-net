# ECE176_U-net

In this project, we reimplement the U-net architecture originally presented in Ronneberger et al.. Our implementation is tested on the MBRSC dataset, which contains aerial imagery of Dubai. Our experiments tested the performance of the architecture with varying approaches to implementation, initialization, and training.
